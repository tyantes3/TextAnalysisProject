## Running the code
First cd into the root directory of the web application(/EE4951W-Final-Project) and then run an npm install
Next cd into the /EE4951W Model directory and run pipenv shell, once the virtual environment is setup run a pipenv install
Finally have two terminals open, the first in the root directory and run: npm run dev. In the second terminal navigate to the EE4951 Model directory and run: python3.11 -m pipenv run flask --app server.py  run --debug. (if on macos or linux you probably won't need the python3.11 -m to run this second command)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
